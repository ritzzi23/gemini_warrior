Breaking it into two separate sentences simplifies the grammatical structure and reduces the cognitive load for sign language interpretation. This allows for clearer visual representation of each concept individually, as each would likely have its own distinct sign.  Furthermore, using the singular forms 'fruit' and 'vegetable' instead of plurals, while slightly altering the meaning, improves clarity and reduces complexity in sign language rendering, as dealing with pluralization through sign language is not always intuitive.",

        "The descriptions for 'fruit' and 'vegetables' are somewhat vague.  While the general idea is conveyed,  more precise handshapes and movements would improve accuracy. Consider specifying the dominant hand and if the non-dominant hand plays a role in either sign.  ASL signs for fruit and vegetables can vary regionally. Providing alternative signs or specifying a signing dialect would enhance clarity. For example, adding a reference to a specific signing system like ASL, BSL, or Auslan would be beneficial. ",
