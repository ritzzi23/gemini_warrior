This simpler structure allows for more natural and fluid signing.",

        "While the descriptions are detailed,  the 'How are you?' translation is somewhat fragmented.  Sign languages often combine elements of 'How,' 'are,' and 'you' into a single, more fluid sign.  The description should ideally reflect this common practice, acknowledging the individual components' potential for combination. Provide an example of the more concise, natural signing.  Perhaps even include a video or animation would enhance the learning experience immensely.",
