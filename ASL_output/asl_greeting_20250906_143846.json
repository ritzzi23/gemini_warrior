Simple sentences are easier to translate directly into signs, which often represent individual concepts, rather than complex grammatical structures.  This approach minimizes ambiguity and ensures clarity.",

        "The 'How are you?' translation is not very compact.  A more fluent sign would likely use a single sign or a shorter sequence than these four separate signs, depending on the regional sign language.",
        "The cultural notes are useful, but they should also acknowledge regional variations, as signs can differ even within the same language family.",
