        "The treatment of the 'am' verb is accurate in its description, explaining the incorporation into the main verb. However, for completeness in instruction, it could explicitly state the combined sign instead of just saying it's incorporated.  For example, it could describe the sign for \"I am hungry\" as a single unit, showing how the index finger pointing to the chest is combined with the hungry sign. This would be more useful for someone learning to sign.",

The written descriptions, while detailed, can be difficult to visualize without prior experience in sign language.",
