        "The description of 'am' is accurate in that it's often incorporated into the sign for 'hungry' in ASL. However, explicitly stating that it's implied could be improved by clarifying that while it isn't a separate sign, the context makes the meaning clear.  The JSON could better reflect this by including a note on how the tense is conveyed within the 'hungry' sign.",
        "The sign for 'hungry' is well-described, although specifying the direction of the circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise) would add clarity.  Adding a visual reference (image or video) would greatly enhance the description.  Additionally, mentioning common variations can improve the understanding of its fluidity in real-world signing.",
        "While the use of a structured JSON is helpful for organization, it may not be the best format for directly conveying the nuanced aspects of sign language.  A more user-friendly method of presenting the information (e.g., incorporating visual aids) should be considered for wider audience accessibility.",
