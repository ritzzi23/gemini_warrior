        "The description of the 'hungry' sign is excellent, capturing the nuance and variability inherent in sign language. However, it could benefit from a visual aid (e.g., a short video or a series of still images) to fully illustrate the 'twisting' motion.  A clearer description of the handshape might also help; specifying the finger positions (e.g., slightly curled, relaxed) would be beneficial.",
        "The handling of the 'am' verb is accurate in terms of ASL grammar, but the explanation could be slightly improved.  Instead of saying it's 'not a separate sign,' state that it's incorporated into the 'hungry' sign's context.  This clarifies that it's not omitted but integrated grammatically.",
