# ASLGEMINI File Processing with Gemini CLI

This demonstrates **local file processing** with Gemini CLI integration - perfect for hackathon judging!

## 🎯 Hackathon Alignment

This file processing system showcases:
- ✅ **Local File Processing**: Reads from `ASL_input/` directory
- ✅ **Gemini CLI Integration**: 3 different AI functions per file
- ✅ **Structured Output**: Saves results to `ASL_output/` directory
- ✅ **Reproducible**: Clear input/output workflow
- ✅ **Judging Friendly**: Easy to understand and demonstrate

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Setup Input Files
```bash
# Add text files to ASL_input directory
echo "I am feeling hungry today." > ../../ASL_input/ritesh_input.txt
echo "Hello, how are you?" > ../../ASL_input/greeting.txt
echo "I want to eat fruits." > ../../ASL_input/food.txt
```

### 2. Run Processing
```bash
# Set your Gemini API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Process all files
python process_files.py
```

### 3. Check Results
```bash
# View generated files
ls ../../ASL_output/

# Check individual results
cat ../../ASL_output/asl_ritesh_input_*.json
```

## 📊 What Gets Generated

For each input file, the system creates:

### 1. **Enhanced Text** (via Gemini CLI)
- Original: "I am feeling hungry today."
- Enhanced: "I am hungry." (simplified for better signing)

### 2. **ASL Signs** (via Gemini CLI)
- **I**: Point to oneself with index finger
- **AM**: Incorporated into verb (not separate sign)
- **HUNGRY**: Bring cupped hand to mouth, mimicking eating

### 3. **Quality Assessment** (via Gemini CLI)
- Accuracy: 9/10
- Completeness: 8/10
- Appropriateness: 9/10
- **Overall: 9/10**

### 4. **Cultural Context**
- Regional variations
- Cultural appropriateness
- Learning tips

## 🔄 Processing Pipeline

```
Input File → Gemini Enhancement → ASL Generation → Quality Assessment → Output File
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓              ↓
ritesh_input.txt → "I am hungry" → [I, AM, HUNGRY] → 9/10 score → asl_ritesh_input.json
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
ASL_input/
├── ritesh_input.txt          # Input text files
└── greeting.txt

ASL_output/
├── asl_ritesh_input_*.json   # Generated ASL results
├── asl_greeting_*.json
└── processing_summary_*.md   # Summary report
```
