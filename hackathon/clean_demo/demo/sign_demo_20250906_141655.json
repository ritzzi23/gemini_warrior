The word \"today\" is redundant in the context of a casual greeting and adds unnecessary complexity for sign language, which often focuses on conveying the core meaning efficiently.  Shorter sentences are generally easier to translate into sign language because they are easier to segment visually and conceptually.",

While 'are' is often incorporated into the signing of 'How are you?',  presenting it as implicitly signed and giving it separate parameters in the JSON is confusing and doesn't accurately reflect how a signer would produce the sign. It should be either removed from the individual word descriptions or integrated into the description of the phrase 'How are you?'",
