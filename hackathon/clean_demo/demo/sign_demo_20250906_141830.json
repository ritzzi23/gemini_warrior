    "reasoning": "The original sentence, \"I am feeling good by looking at you,\" is grammatically correct but somewhat cumbersome for sign language translation.  The improvements made address the following:\n\n1. **Simplified Complex Sentence:** The sentence structure was simplified from a complex sentence (\"I am feeling good by looking at you\") to a simpler declarative sentence (\"I feel good seeing you.\"). This reduces cognitive load for both the signer and the interpreter.\n2. **Broke Down Compound Ideas:** The original sentence combined the act of feeling good with the cause of that feeling (looking).  The enhanced version separates these slightly, focusing on the direct feeling and its trigger. This makes the meaning easier to express visually.\n3. **Clear, Direct Language:** The words \"am feeling\" were replaced with \"feel\" which is more concise and natural in both spoken and signed communication.  \"Seeing you\" is a more direct and visual alternative to \"looking at you.\"\n4. **Maintained Original Meaning:** The core meaning \u2013 the speaker feels good because of the recipient's presence \u2013 is preserved. \n\nSign languages often rely on facial expressions and body language to convey nuances.  A simpler sentence allows for clearer expression of these nuances. The original sentence's phrasing might confuse a signer attempting to convey the 'reason' for feeling good simultaneously with the emotion itself.",
