    "reasoning": "The original sentence is grammatically correct but slightly complex for sign language translation.  Breaking it into two shorter, simpler sentences improves clarity.  \"Thank you\" translates easily in most sign languages.  Separating the expression of gratitude from the acknowledgment of help allows for more natural and expressive signing. Compound sentences can be difficult to translate fluently into sign because they may require holding multiple concepts simultaneously. This simplification reduces the cognitive load on the signer and receiver.",

      "feedback": "The provided SignWriting output is completely unusable and does not represent a valid translation of the English sentence.  SignWriting uses a system of glyphs, not alphanumeric codes like 'M116x500S9904'.  These codes are meaningless without a corresponding SignWriting chart or font that maps them to specific signs.  Even if a chart existed, relying on numerical codes to communicate a signed expression is highly inappropriate and impractical.  To accurately assess the translation, the output must be provided as actual SignWriting glyphs, ideally rendered as an image.  A proper translation would need to show the signs for 'thank you', 'you', and 'help', incorporating appropriate grammatical aspects of the chosen sign language (e.g., subject-verb-object order, non-manual markers).",
