It's easier to translate into sign language because it requires fewer signs and less nuanced expression.",

      "feedback": "The provided SignWriting output \"M103x400S545 M100x400S373\" is not a valid or recognizable representation of a sign language translation for \"Good day!\"  SignWriting uses a specific notation system; this string of alphanumeric characters doesn't conform to any known SignWriting standard. To translate \"Good day!\" accurately, a proper SignWriting transcription would need to depict the handshapes, locations, and movements involved in signing a greeting like \"Good morning\" or \"Good afternoon\" (depending on the time of day), or a more generic positive greeting in the relevant sign language.  The output needs a complete overhaul using the correct SignWriting conventions.  Consider specifying the sign language (e.g., American Sign Language, British Sign Language) for a more accurate and helpful response.",
