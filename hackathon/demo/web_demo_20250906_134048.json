Breaking it into two simple sentences improves clarity and allows each concept ('hello' and 'how are you') to be signed individually, making it easier for a deaf or hard-of-hearing person to understand and for a signer to express.",

SignWriting uses a system of notation to represent handshapes, movements, and locations of signs.  The given strings of 'M104x600S7780', etc.,  don't correspond to any known SignWriting conventions or established sign language lexicon.  To improve, a proper SignWriting transcription or, even better, a video showing the signs in a specific sign language (e.g., American Sign Language - ASL) is needed.  The system must use correct SignWriting notation or an equivalent standardized system if a different method of notation is used.",
