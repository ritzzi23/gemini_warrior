    "reasoning": "The original sentence, \"I want to eat fruits,\" contains a slightly complex verb phrase (\"want to eat\") and uses the plural \"fruits\" which might be harder to convey clearly in sign language depending on the context (e.g., specifying a type of fruit vs. fruit in general).  Simplifying to \"I want fruit\" removes the unnecessary verb and makes the sentence more concise and easier to sign.  The meaning remains the same if the signer intends to convey a desire for any kind of fruit.",
