# Phase 10: Snapdragon X Elite Optimization & Deployment

## Objective
Optimize SignBridge and its AI models for maximum performance on Snapdragon X Elite devices, leveraging the NPU, GPU, and ARM CPU. Ensure the app and models are packaged, accelerated, and tested for the Snapdragon platform.

---

## Key Goals
- Convert and optimize AI models for Snapdragon NPU (Hexagon)
- Leverage Qualcomm AI Engine Direct, ONNX Runtime, or TensorFlow Lite for hardware acceleration
- Profile and tune app and model performance
- Ensure compatibility and smooth user experience on Snapdragon X Elite

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. **Familiarize with Snapdragon AI Stack & Tools**
- Review official docs:
  - [Qualcomm AI Hub](https://aihub.qualcomm.com/)
  - [ONNX Runtime: Build models for Snapdragon](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/genai/howto/build-models-for-snapdragon.html)
  - [Qualcomm AI Engine Direct SDK]
- Set up a Snapdragon X Elite development device or emulator

### 2. **Model Conversion & Optimization**
- For each AI model (e.g., Whisper, SignWriting translation):
  - Convert to ONNX format if not already
  - Use Qualcomm AI Hub to compile and optimize models for Snapdragon NPU:
    - Sign up for AI Hub and obtain API token
    - Install `qai_hub_models` Python package
    - Generate QNN context binaries for target device (Snapdragon X Elite)
    - Generate ONNX wrapper models using provided scripts
    - Download additional assets as needed (tokenizers, configs)
  - (Optional) Quantize models to INT8/float16 for further acceleration

### 3. **Integrate Optimized Models into Backend**
- Update backend to use ONNX Runtime with QNN (Qualcomm NPU) execution provider
- Ensure correct model paths and assets are bundled for Tauri/desktop packaging
- Add runtime checks to select the best execution provider (QNN, CPU, GPU) based on device

### 4. **App-Level Performance Tuning**
- Profile end-to-end latency (audio-to-signwriting-to-animation)
- Use multi-threading and async I/O where possible
- Minimize memory usage and avoid unnecessary data copies
- Optimize frontend rendering for ARM/Adreno GPU (e.g., use WebGL/WebGPU for animation)

### 5. **Testing & Profiling on Snapdragon**
- Use Qualcomm AI Hub profiling tools to measure model latency, memory, and compute unit usage
- Test all app features on Snapdragon X Elite hardware:
  - Audio recording and playback
  - Model inference (speech-to-text, translation, pose generation)
  - Animation rendering
- Compare performance with x86/other ARM devices
- Identify and address bottlenecks

### 6. **Documentation & Best Practices**
- Document the model conversion and deployment process
- Provide troubleshooting tips for common Snapdragon issues (e.g., missing drivers, SDK setup)
- Share performance benchmarks and tuning results
- Add notes on maintaining compatibility with other platforms (fallback to CPU/GPU if NPU unavailable)

## Deliverables
- Optimized ONNX/QNN models for Snapdragon X Elite
- Updated backend with QNN/ONNX Runtime integration
- Performance profiling reports and benchmarks
- Documentation for Snapdragon deployment and optimization
