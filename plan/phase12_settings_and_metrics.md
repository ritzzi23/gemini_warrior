# Phase 12: Settings, Metrics, and Documentation

## Objective
Enhance SignBridge with a user-accessible settings UI, model/quality selection, real-time performance metrics, and comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

---

## Key Goals
- Add a settings panel for user preferences and advanced options
- Allow model selection and quality/performance tuning
- Display real-time performance metrics (FPS, latency)
- Provide clear user and API documentation

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. **Settings UI**
- Add a settings button or menu in the main UI
- Allow users to select:
  - Preferred model (e.g., Whisper size, translation model)
  - Quality vs. speed tradeoff (e.g., quantized vs. full-precision)
  - Audio input device (mic/system)
  - Language and accessibility options
- Persist settings using local storage or config files

### 2. **Performance Metrics**
- Display FPS and end-to-end latency in the UI (e.g., overlay, status bar, or settings panel)
- Log metrics for debugging and optimization
- Optionally, allow users to export performance logs

### 3. **Documentation**
- Write a user guide covering:
  - Installation and setup (including system audio)
  - Using all features (recording, streaming, settings)
  - Troubleshooting and FAQs
- Write API documentation for backend endpoints and model integration
- Document performance tuning and known limitations

---

## Deliverables
- Settings UI with model/quality selection
- Real-time performance metrics in the app
- Comprehensive user and API documentation
