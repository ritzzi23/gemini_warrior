# Phase 1: Speech-to-Text (Offline)

## Objective
Implement offline speech-to-text transcription using Whisper.cpp to enable on-device audio transcription without internet dependency.

## Tasks
1. Choose and compile Whisper.cpp for target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Snapdragon X Elite).
2. Integrate Whisper.cpp executable with Python backend via subprocess calls.
3. Create FastAPI endpoint `/transcribe` to receive audio data, save as WAV, and run Whisper.cpp for transcription.
4. Test transcription accuracy and performance with sample audio files.
5. Ensure offline functionality and low latency.

## Resources
- Whisper.cpp repository: https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp

## Deliverables
- Compiled Whisper.cpp binaries for all platforms.
- Python FastAPI `/transcribe` endpoint.
- Sample audio transcription tests.
