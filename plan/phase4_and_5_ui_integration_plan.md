# Phases 4 & 5: SignWriting Animation Rendering and Cross-Platform UI Packaging - Implementation and Integration Plan

## Objective
Build a beautiful, accessible, and performant cross-platform UI for SignBridge that includes real-time audio capture, transcription, text simplification toggle, and live SignWriting animation rendering. Package the app for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Snapdragon X Elite using Tauri.

## Framework and Libraries Decision

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
  - Reasoning:
    - Familiarity: You are already familiar with React and Next.js.
    - Ecosystem: React has a rich ecosystem and excellent support for component-based UI.
    - Flexibility: React works well with Tauri and can be used without Next.js for desktop apps.
    - Performance: React with hooks and context API can efficiently manage state and updates.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  - Reasoning:
    - Utility-first CSS framework that speeds up styling.
    - Supports dark mode easily.
    - Highly customizable and widely adopted.
- **3D Animation Rendering**: Three.js integrated via React components
  - Use the existing ThreeService logic adapted to React.
  - Use `<model-viewer>` web component for 3D model rendering.
- **State Management**: React Context or Zustand (lightweight)
  - Manage microphone state, transcription text, simplification toggle, and animation data.
- **Audio Capture**: Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` for microphone.
  - Explore system audio capture options if feasible.
- **Backend Communication**: Use Fetch API or Axios to call FastAPI endpoints.
- **Packaging**: Tauri with React frontend and Python backend sidecar.
  - Use Tauri sidecar feature to bundle and manage Python backend.
  - Create build scripts for all target platforms.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 4: Animation Rendering Integration

1. Adapt the Angular `AnimationComponent` logic to React.
2. Implement a React `ThreeService` hook or context to load and provide Three.js utilities.
3. Integrate `<model-viewer>` for 3D character rendering.
4. Implement animation state subscription and update logic.
5. Load 3D assets and support platform-specific formats.
6. Apply styling and support dark mode.
7. Test animation rendering and performance.

### Phase 5: UI Components and Packaging

1. Build UI components:
   - Microphone start/stop button.
   - Text simplification toggle.
   - Live transcription display.
   - Live SignWriting animation window.
2. Implement audio capture and streaming to backend.
3. Connect UI components to backend API endpoints.
4. Implement state management for app data.
5. Configure Tauri to bundle React frontend and Python backend.
6. Create build scripts for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Snapdragon X Elite.
7. Write README.md with setup, build, run instructions, and API key configuration.
8. Test full app workflow on all platforms.

## Deliverables

- React frontend with Tailwind CSS styling.
- Real-time audio capture and transcription UI.
- Live SignWriting animation rendering.
- Cross-platform packaged app installers.
- Documentation and build scripts.
